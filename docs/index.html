	    <h1>Mafia Three</h1>
		<p>It's 1968 and the rules have changed. After years in Vietnam, Lincoln Clay knows this truth: Family isn't who you're born with, it's who you die for. Now back home, in a re imagined New Orleans, Lincoln is set on rebuilding his life, but old ties keep him from leaving the city. It will take more than a few friends to make it in this new world. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, it's possible to make it to the top of the city's underworld. It's time to create a new family. A vast, diverse and seedy open world ruled by the mob and corrupt officials and richly detailed with the sights, sounds and emotionally-charged social atmosphere of the era. Be Lincoln Clay, an orphan and Vietnam veteran hell bent on revenge against the Italian Mafia for the brutal slaughter of the black mob, the closest thing to family he’s ever had. Choose your own personal play-style, from brutal force and blazing guns to stalk-and-kill tactics as you use Lincoln's military training and gathered intel to tear down the Italian Mafia. Building a criminal empire takes muscle and firepower. As the new boss in town, your new family is showing their loyalty with territory Kick-Back gifts to help you take down your enemies and own the city. Build a new criminal empire in your own unique way by deciding which of your lieutenants you reward and which you betray...</p>
